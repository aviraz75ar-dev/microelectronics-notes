# Backside Power Delivery Networks (BPDN)

## 1. Concept & Motivation
- What problem does BPDN solve?
- Why frontside PDN is limiting at advanced nodes (IR drop, routing congestion, etc.).
- High-level idea of moving power rails to the backside.

## 2. Basic Architecture
- Cross-section description (frontside logic, backside metal stack, power vias).
- Key elements: power vias, backside metals, redistribution layers.
- Integration with standard FEOL/BEOL.

## 3. Process & Integration Challenges
- Additional process modules required.
- Alignment and via drilling challenges.
- Mechanical and stress implications.

## 4. Typical Failure Modes
- Open/short defects in power vias.
- Delamination, cracks, or voids.
- EM, TDDB, stress-migration specific to BPDN.

## 5. Electrical & Reliability Impact
- Effect on IR drop and noise.
- Impact on transient response.
- Long-term reliability concerns.

## 6. Relevant FA / FI Techniques
- How to localize failures in BPDN structures.
- Cross-sectioning strategies.
- Imaging and analytical methods (e.g., PFIB, X-section TEM).

## 7. Notes from Practice / Open Questions
- Practical observations / rules of thumb.
- Open integration or reliability questions.
- Links to key papers / references (to be added).
