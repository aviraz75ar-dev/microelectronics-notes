# Microelectronics Notes

A structured knowledge base capturing key concepts, methods, tools, and practical experience across:

- Advanced packaging & 3D integration  
- Backside power delivery and process technology  
- Device physics and transistor scaling  
- High-speed & optical interconnect systems  
- Die, package & system-level test methodologies  
- Fault isolation techniques  
- Failure analysis (destructive & non-destructive)  
- Simulation, modeling & tooling workflows  

Built to consolidate expertise from advanced semiconductor development (Intel) and prepare for advanced interconnect & packaging roles (NVIDIA).
